SeeAlsoPlus
===========

Extension to provide additional info about the remote items referenced by the
"see also" URLs on bugs. Aimed to replace existing EnhancedSeeAlso extension.


Key improvements

 * Caching of the remote data
 * Easily extensioble to support other than bugzilla URLs
 * Web service methods


Currently only has support for Bugzilla URLs and the remote item info is not
shown in the bug view, only webservice method provided to fetch the data.
(As this started from the ideas around bug cloning tool and that's all that was
needed for it)
